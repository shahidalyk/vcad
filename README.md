# VCAD - Volunteer Computing on Android Devices

Details at: <a href="http://shahidalyk.com/">shahidalyk.com</a>

Nowadays, Grid computing, Cloud computing and high performance computing are useful for solving computationally intensive jobs. Realization of these computing models are mainly used in scientific research, business and social applications. But with the exponential increase in data, these computing resources are becoming less effective day by day. There is always a need of more computing resources to save time and cost.

In 1996, volunteer computing for desktop computers introduced donation of computing resources such as processing power and storage over the internet. It was successful for projects having high computational and data intensive jobs (SETI@home, CERN projects and Einstein@home etc.). But desktop pc has high cost in terms of power usage and efficiency. Plus, there is a decrease of desktop pc usage in the recent years. Which has also affected volunteer computing projects.

Mobile devices can solve the same computational jobs for less cost in terms of time and power usage. The smartphone and tablets are becoming increasingly powerful and rising in popularity. Nowadays, a smartphone with is packed with up to 4GB of RAM and up to Octa-core processors, which makes them capable of doing heavy computations and processing. Most of the time the smartphone is idle or using less resources. 

The idle resources can be used in a productive way, these idle processor cycles can be used to support experiment that making human life better, these are the projects which need huge computational resources that can be provided through hundreds of smartphones available. A large project can be fragmented as work units or small jobs that can be completed in a given time. These jobs can be run on mobile phones and results are compiled. 


The software system's Multi-tiered Client Server Architecture can be divided in:

1. Server Software.
2. Middleware.
3. Client Software/Android Application.

## Software Methodology:
Agile - Extreme Programming

## Software Design
February 15, 2016

Created Software design with components and interfaces using object oriented approach. The design document contains System Architecture and trade-offs on software quality attributes, design methodology details, data representation (Database design and description), design models, algorithms pseudo code and UML diagrams. A Sequence diagram from the document is below.

## Implementation
Continuous

The tools and technologies being used are Python, Java, Flask, MongoDB, Azure VM, D3.js, Android Development Studio, Visio

## Software Testing
April 04, 2016

Wrote test document with various test cases and results.
